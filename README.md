# Aisle-Finder

This is an a program that allows users to create a shopping list and then generate aisle numbers for every item that is contained in the database. The code works, but the biggest issue was generating data for the database. I used three stores to act as samples. It has additional functionality, like removing, updating, adding an item to the database, etc. My initial thought was to allow users to generate the aisle data themselves like a crowdsourcing project.
